# axb

Various expressions of Ax = b, or Gm = d if you prefer, to illustrate linear inversion in geophysical problems.

This is a chrestomathy, sort of. I'm trying to reproduce the same (more or less) workflow in all of the following languages:

- [Python NumPy](NumPy.ipynb)
- [Julia](Julia.ipynb)
- [Lua Torch](Torch.ipynb)
- [R](R.ipynb)
- [NumericJS](NumericJS.ipynb)

The idea is to use the fundamentals of linear algebra (dot products, inverses, etc), rather than high-level functions. But where those high-level solving functions exist, we should mention and illustrate them too.

All of these notebooks can certainly be improved upon: suggestions and pull requests welcome!


## Mauricio Sacchi's course

This series of notebooks was inspired by [Mauricio Sacchi's course notes](https://www.ualberta.ca/~msacchi/GEOPH431_531/linear_intro.pdf), which includes MATLAB implementations, and grew from there.


## Other learning resources

I've found the following resources very helpful.

- [Stephen Boyd's notes](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee263/ee263.1082/notes/ee263coursereader.pdf) from his course on [linear dynamical systems](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE263) at Stanford.
- [Mauricio Sacchi's notes](http://www.mathtube.org/sites/default/files/lecture-notes/Sacchi_MD.pdf) from his course at the University of Alberta. 
- [Francis Jones and Doug Oldenberg's intro to linear algebra](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/ubcgif/iag/tutorials/invn-theoryintro/norms-misfit.htm) from their courses at UBC.
